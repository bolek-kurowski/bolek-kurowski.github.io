I tried blogging in the past a few times. Mostly related to photography and I learned one thing - keep it simple.

The primary and only reason I've set this up is **Me**. *I know this sounds damn arrogant.* So the key three reasons are:

1. I wanted to learn something new - Octopress looks really cool
2. I wanted to keep track of all of those great articles that I read
3. I sometimes want to just write down some of my own thoughts and ideas related to programming

That's it. *Let's make it happen.*
